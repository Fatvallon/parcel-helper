# Parcel Helper

Quick way to manage a ton of parcels and old messages in your inbox.

## Features:
* Instantly accepts all parcels on every page.
* Instantly deletes every read message on all pages.


## Chat Commands
* !GetMail
* !DeleteMail or !DelMail

Commands are not case-sensitive, they can be all lower-case (!getmail), upper (!GETMAIL), whatever (!gEtMaiL)


## Known Issues
* Claiming parcels when the mailbox is open might cause the procedure to halt mid-way. Closing the mailbox will trigger the procedure to continue. Workaround is to make sure the mailbox window is closed before calling !getmail.


## Changelog 
### 1.1.0
* [+] Added [slash](https://github.com/baldera-mods/slash) support
