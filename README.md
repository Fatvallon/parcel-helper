# Parcel Helper

Quick way to manage a ton of parcels and old messages in your inbox.

## Features:
* Instantly accepts all parcels on every page.
* Instantly deletes every read message on all pages.


## Chat Commands
* !GetMail
* !DeleteMail or !DelMail

Commands are not case-sensitive, they can be all lower-case (!getmail), upper (!GETMAIL), whatever (!gEtMaiL)


## Known Issues
* Claiming all parcels when the mail window is already open might cause the procedure to halt, closing the mail window will trigger the procedure to continue. Workaround is to make sure mail window is closed before calling !getmail.


## Changelog 
### 1.1.0
* [+] Added slash support
