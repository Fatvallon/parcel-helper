## Chat Commands
* !GetMail
* !DeleteMail or !DelMail

Commands are not case-sensitive, they can be all lower-case (!getmail), upper (!GETMAIL), mixed (!GetMail)

* Claiming all parcels when the mail window is already open might cause the function to pause, closing and reopening mail window will trigger function to continue. Workaround is to make sure mail window is closed before calling !getmail.
